#### Q&A
**Q:** Why do certain countries have scrapers for its states/provinces/regions
       while others have a single scraper for the whole country?  
**A:** This depends on the data source. If a source contains content for the
       whole country, a single scraper is needed. It's more common for a data
       source to exist for a region within a country, than for the whole country.
